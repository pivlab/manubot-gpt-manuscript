## Evaluations of AI-based revisions {#sec:results}

### Evaluation setup

<!-- In addition, there could be multiple different yet valid revisions with a varying degree of quality. -->
Assessing the performance of text generation tasks is challenging, and this is especially true for automatic revisions of scientific content.
In this context, we need to make sure the revision does not change the original meaning or introduce incorrect or misleading information.
For this reason, our approach emphasizes human assessments of the revisions to mitigate these issues, and we followed the same procedure in evaluating our tool.
We used three manuscripts of our own authorship (see below), which allowed us to more objectively assess changes in the original meaning and whether revisions kept important details.
During the prompt engineering phase (see below), we also used a unit testing framework to ensure that the revisions produced by our prompts met a minimum set of quality measures.

#### Language models

We evaluated our AI-assisted revision workflow using three GPT-3 models from OpenAI: `text-davinci-003`, `text-davinci-edit-001`, and `text-curie-001`.
The first two are based on the most capable GPT-3 Davinci models (see [OpenAI - GPT-3 models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3)).
Whereas `text-davinci-003` is a production-ready model for the completion endpoint, `text-davinci-edit-001` is used for the edits endpoint and was still in beta at the time of testing.
The latter provides a more natural interface for revising manuscripts, as it takes two inputs: instructions and the text to revise.
Model `text-curie-001` is faster and cheaper than Davinci models and is defined as "very capable" by its authors (see [OpenAI - GPT-3 models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3)).

<!-- Using these manuscripts, we tested and improved our prompts. -->
<!-- Our findings are reported below. -->
For the evaluation of our tool, we used three manuscripts of our own authorship (Table @tbl:manuscripts): the Clustermatch Correlation Coefficient (CCC) [@doi:10.1101/2022.06.15.496326], PhenoPLIER [@doi:10.1038/s41467-023-41057-4], and Manubot-AI (this manuscript).
CCC is a new correlation coefficient evaluated in transcriptomic data, while PhenoPLIER is a framework that comprises three different methods applied in the field of genetic studies.
CCC is in the field of computational biology, whereas PhenoPLIER is in the field of genomic medicine.
CCC describes one computational method applied to one data type (correlation to gene expression).
PhenoPLIER describes a framework that comprises three different approaches (regression, clustering, and drug-disease prediction) using data from genome-wide and transcription-wide association studies (GWAS and TWAS), gene expression, and transcriptional responses to small molecule perturbations.
Therefore, CCC has a simpler structure, whereas PhenoPLIER is a more complex manuscript with more figures and tables and a Methods section including equations.
The third manuscript, Manubot-AI, provides an example with a much simpler structure, and it was written and revised using our tool before submission, which provides a more real AI-based revision use case.

#### Evaluation using human assessments

<!-- We discuss below our findings based on these PRs across different sections of the manuscripts. -->
We have enabled the Manubot AI revision workflow in the GitHub repositories of the three manuscripts (CCC, PhenoPLIER, and Manubot-AI).
This has added the "ai-revision" workflow to the "Actions" tab of each repository.
We manually triggered the workflow and utilized the three language models mentioned earlier to generate one pull request (PR) for each manuscript and model.
These PRs can be found in the "Pull requests" tab of each repository.
They are titled "GPT (MODEL) used to revise manuscript," with "MODEL" representing the identifier of the model used.
The PRs display all the differences between the original text and the AI-based revision suggestions.


When manually assessing the quality of the revisions, we considered whether the revision: 1) preserve the original meaning, 2) preserve important details, 4) introduced new and incorrect information, and 5) preserve the correct Markdown format (e.g., citations, equations).


#### Prompt engineering

We extensively tested our tool, including prompts, using a unit testing framework.
Our unit tests cover the general processing of the manuscript content (such as splitting by paragraphs), the generation of custom prompts using the manuscript metadata, writing back the text suggestions (ensuring that the original style is preserved as much as possible to minimize the number of changes), and, more importantly, some basic quality measures of the revised text.
The latter set of unit tests was used during our prompt engineering work, and they ensure that section-specific prompts yield revisions with a minimum set of quality measures.
For instance, we wrote unit tests to check that revised Abstracts consist of a single paragraph, start with a capital letter, end with a period, and that no citations to other articles are included.
For the Introduction section, we check that a certain percentage of citations are kept, which also attempts to give the model some flexibility to remove text deemed unnecessary.
We found that adding the instruction "most of the citations to other academic papers are kept" to the prompt was enough to achieve this with the most capable model.
We also wrote unit tests to ensure the models returned citations in the correct Manubot/Markdown format (e.g., [@doi:...] or [@arxiv:...]), and found that no changes to the prompt were needed for this (i.e., the model automatically detected the correct format in most cases).
For the Results section, we included tests with short inline formulas in LaTeX (e.g., $\gamma_l$) and references to figures, tables, equations, or other sections (e.g., Figure @id or Equation (@id)) and found that, in the majority of cases, the most capable model was able to correctly keep them with the right format.
For the Methods section, in addition to the aforementioned tests, we also evaluated the ability of models to use the correct format for the definition of numbered, multiline equations, and found that the most capable model succeeded in most cases.
For this particular case, we needed to modify our prompt to explicitly mention the correct format of multiline equations (see prompt for Methods in Figure @fig:ai_revision).


We also included tests where the model is expected to fail in generating a revision (for instance, when the input paragraph is too long for the model's context length).
In these cases, we ensure that the tool returns a proper error message.
We ran our unit tests across all models under evaluation.


### General assessment of language models

Our initial human assessments across the three manuscripts and unit tests revealed that, although faster and less expensive, the Curie model was not able to produce acceptable revisions for any of the manuscripts.
The PRs show that most of its suggestions were not coherent with the original text in any of the manuscript sections.
The model clearly did not understand the revision instructions as it often did not produce meaningful revisions.
Instead, it replaced the text with the instructions, added the title of the manuscript at the beginning of the paragraph, consistently failed to include citations to other articles (especially in the Introduction section), or added content that was not present in the original text.
Additionally, we found that the quality of the revisions produced by the `text-davinci-edit-001` model (edits endpoint) was inferior to that of the `text-davinci-003` model (completion endpoint), possibly because the edits endpoint was still in beta at the time of testing.
The `text-davinci-003` model consistently produced the best results for all manuscripts and across the different sections.
This led us to focus on the `text-davinci-003` model for the rest of the evaluation below.


### Revision of different sections

<!-- These are our subjective assessments of the quality of the revisions, and we encourage the reader to inspect the PRs for each manuscript and model to see the full diffs and make their own conclusions. -->
Following our criteria (see above), we inspected the PRs generated by the AI-based workflow and report on our assessment of the changes suggested by the tool across different sections of the manuscripts.
The reader can access the PRs in the manuscripts' GitHub repositories (Table @tbl:manuscripts) and also included as diff files in Supplementary File 1 (CCC), 2 (PhenoPLIER) and 3 (Manubot-AI).


Below, we present the differences between the original text and the revisions made by the tool in a `diff` format obtained from GitHub.
Line numbers are included to show the length differences.
Unless the AI suggestions represent a complete overhaul of the text, single words are underlined and highlighted in colors to more clearly see the differences within a single sentence.
Red indicates words removed by the tool, green indicates words added, and no underlining indicates words kept unchanged.
In the GitHub repositories, the full diffs can be seen by clicking on the "Files changes" tab under each PR.


#### Abstract

![
**Abstract of CCC.**
Original text is on the left and suggested revision on the right.
Single words are not underlined/highlighed in this case because the revision completely overhauled the text.
](images/diffs/abstract/ccc-abstract.svg "Diffs - CCC abstract"){#fig:abstract:ccc width="75%"}

We applied the AI-based revision workflow to the CCC abstract (Figure @fig:abstract:ccc).
The tool completely rewrote the text, leaving only the last sentence mostly unchanged.
The text was significantly shortened, with longer sentences than the original ones, which could make the abstract slightly harder to read.
The revision removed the first two sentences that introduced correlation analyses and transcriptomics and directly stated the purpose of the manuscript.
It also removed details about the method (line 5) and focused on the aims and results obtained, ending with the same last sentence, suggesting a broader application of the coefficient to other data domains (as originally intended by the authors of CCC).
The main concepts were still present in the revised text.


The revised text for the abstract of PhenoPLIER was significantly shortened (from 10 sentences in the original, to only 3 in the revised version).
However, in this case, important concepts (such as GWAS, TWAS, CRISPR) and a proper amount of background information were missing, producing a less informative abstract.


#### Introduction

![
**First paragraph in the Introduction section of CCC.**
Original text is on the left and suggested revision on the right.
](images/diffs/introduction/ccc-paragraph-01.svg "Diffs - CCC introduction paragraph 01"){#fig:intro:ccc width="75%"}

The tool significantly revised the Introduction section of CCC (Figure @fig:intro:ccc), producing a more concise and clear introductory paragraph.
The revised first sentence concisely incorporated ideas from the original two sentences, introducing the concept of "large datasets" and the opportunities for scientific exploration.
The model generated a more concise second sentence introducing the "need for efficient tools" to find "multiple relationships" in these datasets.
The third sentence connected nicely with the previous one.
All references to scientific literature were kept in the correct Manubot format, although our prompts do not specify the reference format.
The rest of the sentences in this section were also correctly revised and could be incorporated into the manuscript with minor or no further changes.


We also observed a high-quality revision of the introduction of PhenoPLIER.
However, the model failed to maintain the format of citations in one paragraph.
Additionally, the model did not converge to a revised text for the last paragraph, and our tool left an error message as an HTML comment at the top: "The AI model returned an empty string." Debugging the prompts revealed this issue, which could be related to the complexity of the paragraph.
In such cases, rerunning the automated revision might solve this type of issue.


#### Results

![
**A paragraph in the Results section of CCC.**
Original text is on the left and suggested revision on the right.
Single words are not underlined/highlighed in this case because the revision completely overhauled the text.
](images/diffs/results/ccc-paragraph-01.svg "Diffs - CCC results paragraph 01"){#fig:results:ccc width="75%"}

We tested the tool on a paragraph from the Results section of CCC (Figure @fig:results:ccc).
This paragraph describes Figure 1 of the CCC manuscript [@doi:10.1101/2022.06.15.496326], which displays four different datasets with two variables each, showcasing various relationships or patterns such as random/independent, non-coexistence, quadratic, and two-lines.
The revised paragraph is more concise, using slightly longer sentences and consistently employing the past tense.
In addition, all citations were retained, which is important despite not being explicitly mentioned in the prompts for this section (unlike introductions).
The original LaTeX format for mathematical notation was preserved, and the figure was correctly referenced using the Manubot syntax.
In the third sentence of the revised paragraph (line 3), the model generated a good summary of how all coefficients performed in the last two nonlinear patterns and why CCC was able to capture them.
As human authors, we would make a single change to the end of this sentence to avoid repeating the word "complexity": *"..., while CCC increased the complexity of the model ~~by using different degrees of complexity~~ to capture the relationships"*.
Overall, the revised paragraph provides a clearer description of the figure's content and how CCC operates.
It is worth noting that the model condensed some of the concepts from the original paragraph (lines 4 to 8) into three new sentences (lines 3 to 5) with the same meaning but in a more concise and clear manner.
The model also produced high-quality revisions for several other paragraphs that would only require minor adjustments.


Other paragraphs in CCC, however, needed more changes before being ready to be incorporated into the manuscript.
For instance, in some paragraphs, the model generated a revised text that is shorter, more direct, and clear.
However, it removed important details and sometimes altered the meaning of sentences.
To address this, we can accept the simplified sentence structure but add back the missing details.


![
**A paragraph in the Results section of PhenoPLIER.**
Original text is on the left and suggested revision on the right.
Single words are not underlined/highlighed in this case because the revision completely overhauled the text.
](images/diffs/results/phenoplier-paragraph-01.svg "Diffs - PhenoPLIER results paragraph 01"){#fig:results:phenoplier width="75%"}


When applied to the PhenoPLIER manuscript, the model produced high-quality revisions for most paragraphs, while preserving citations and references to figures, tables, and other sections of the manuscript in the Manubot/Markdown format.
In some cases, important details were missing, but they could be easily added back while preserving the improved sentence structure of the revised version.
In other cases, the model's output demonstrated the limitations of revising one paragraph at a time without considering the rest of the text.

For instance, one paragraph described our CRISPR screening approach to assess whether top genes in a latent variable (LV) could represent good therapeutic targets.
The model generated a paragraph with a completely different meaning (Figure @fig:results:phenoplier).
It omitted the CRISPR screen and the gene symbols associated with the regulation of lipids, which were key elements in the original text.
Instead, the new text describes an experiment that does not exist with a reference to a non-existing section.
This suggests that the model focused on the title and keywords of the manuscript (Table @tbl:manuscripts) that were part of every prompt (Figure @fig:ai_revision). 

For example, it included the idea of "gene co-expression" analysis (a keyword) to identify "therapeutic targets" (another keyword) and replaced the mention of "sets of genes" in the original text with "clusters of genes" (closer to the keyword including "clustering").
This was a poor model-based revision, indicating that the original paragraph may be too short or disconnected from the rest and could be merged with the next one (which describes follow-up and related experiments).


#### Discussion

In both the CCC and PhenoPLIER manuscripts, revisions to the discussion section appeared to be of high quality.
The model kept the correct format when necessary (e.g., using italics for gene symbols), maintained most of the citations, and improved the readability of the text in general.
Revisions for some paragraphs introduced minor mistakes that a human author could readily fix.

![
**A paragraph in the Discussion section of CCC.**
Original text is on the left and suggested revision on the right.
](images/diffs/discussion/ccc-paragraph-01.svg "Diffs - CCC discussion paragraph 01"){#fig:discussion:ccc width="75%"}

One paragraph of CCC discusses how not-only-linear correlation coefficients could potentially impact genetic studies of complex traits (Figure @fig:discussion:ccc).
Although some minor changes could be made, we believe the revised text reads better than the original.
It is also interesting how the model understood the format of citations and built more complex structures from it.
For instance, the two articles referenced in lines 2 and 3 in the original text were correctly merged into a single citation block and separated with ";" in line 2 of the revised text.


#### Methods

Prompts for the Methods section were the most challenging to design, especially when the sections included equations.
The prompt for Methods (Figure @fig:ai_revision) is more focused in keeping the technical details, which was especially important for PhenoPLIER, whose Methods section contains paragraphs with several mathematical expressions.

![
**A paragraph in the Methods section of PhenoPLIER.**
Original text is on the left and suggested revision on the right.
](images/diffs/methods/phenoplier-paragraph-01.svg "Diffs - PhenoPLIER methods paragraph 01"){#fig:methods:phenoplier width="75%"}

We revised a paragraph in PhenoPLIER that contained two numbered equations (Figure @fig:methods:phenoplier).
The model made very few changes, and all the equations, citations, and most of the original text were preserved.
However, we found it remarkable how the model identified an incorrect reference to a mathematical symbol (line 8) and corrected it in the revision (line 7).
Indeed, the equation with the univariate model used by PrediXcan (lines 4-6 in the original) includes the *true* effect size $\gamma_l$ (`\gamma_l`) instead of the *estimated* one $\hat{\gamma}_l$ (`\hat{\gamma}_l`).


In PhenoPLIER, we found one large paragraph with several equations that the model failed to revise, although it performed relatively well in revising the rest of the section.
In CCC, the revision of this section was good overall, with some minor and easy-to-fix issues as in the other sections.


We also observed issues when revising one paragraph at a time without context.
For instance, in PhenoPLIER, one of the initial paragraphs mentions the linear models used by S-PrediXcan and S-MultiXcan without providing any equations or details.
These were presented in the subsequent paragraphs, but since the model had not encountered them yet, it chose to immediately add those equations in the correct Manubot/Markdown format.


![
**A paragraph in the Methods section of ManubotAI.**
Original text is on the left and suggested revision on the right.
The revision (right) contains a repeated set of sentences at the top that we removed to improve the clarity of the figure.
](images/diffs/methods/manubotai-paragraph-01.svg "Diffs - ManubotAI methods paragraph 01"){#fig:methods:manubotai width="75%"}


When revising the Methods sections of Manubot-AI (this manuscript), in some cases, the model added novel sentences with incorrect information.
For instance, in one paragraph, it added a formula (using the correct Manubot format) to presumably predict the cost of a revision run.
In another paragraph (Figure @fig:methods:manubotai), it included new sentences stating that the model was "trained on a corpus of scientific papers from the same field as the manuscript" and that its suggested revisions resulted in a "modified version of the manuscript that is ready for submission".
While these are important areas for future development, neither accurately represents the current work.
