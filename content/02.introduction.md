## Introduction

The paragraph is well-written, but there are a few minor adjustments that could be made for clarity and style:

The tradition of scholarly writing dates back thousands of years and has evolved significantly with the advent of scientific journals approximately 350 years ago ([@isbn:0810808447]).
External peer review, used by many journals, is even more recent, having been around for less than 100 years ([@doi:10/d26d8b]).
Most manuscripts are written by individuals or teams of researchers working together to describe new advances, summarize existing literature, or argue for changes in the status quo.
However, scholarly writing is a time-consuming process in which the results of a study are presented using a specific style and format.
Academics can sometimes be long-winded in getting to the key points, making their writing more impenetrable to their audience ([@doi:10.1038/d41586-018-02404-4]).

Notes:
1.
Removed "humans" as it is implied that researchers are human and it sounds a bit redundant.
2.
"which is used by many journals" changed to "used by many journals" for conciseness.
3.
"where results of a study" changed to "in which the results of a study" for grammatical correctness.
4.
"making writing more impenetrable" changed to "making their writing more impenetrable" to clarify that it is the academics' writing that is being referred to.

The paragraph is well-structured and informative, with appropriate references to academic works.
Below are a few minor corrections and suggestions to improve clarity and grammatical accuracy:

Recent advances in computing capabilities and the widespread availability of text, images, and other data on the internet have laid the foundation for artificial intelligence (AI) models with billions of parameters.
Large language models (LLMs), in particular, are opening the floodgates to new technologies with the capability to transform how society operates [1].
OpenAI's models, for instance, have been trained on vast amounts of data and can generate human-like text [2].
These models are based on the transformer architecture, which uses self-attention mechanisms to model the complexities of language.
The most well-known of these models is the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT-3 and, more recently, GPT-4), which has been shown to be highly effective for a range of language tasks such as generating text, completing code, and answering questions [2].
In the realm of medical informatics, scientists are beginning to explore the utility of these tools in optimizing clinical decision support [3] and assessing their potential to reduce health disparities [4], while also raising concerns about their impact on medical education [5] and the importance of keeping the human aspect central in AI development and application [6].
These tools have also been used to enhance scientific communication [7].
This technology has the potential to revolutionize how scientists write and revise scholarly manuscripts, saving time and effort and enabling researchers to focus on more high-level tasks such as data analysis and interpretation.
However, the use of LLMs in research has sparked controversy, primarily due to their propensity to generate plausible yet factually incorrect or misleading information.

Corrections made:
1.
Added a comma after "architecture" for clarity.
2.
Changed "have been also used" to "have also been used" for better sentence flow.
3.
Standardized the tense by changing "have been shown" to "has been shown" to be consistent with the singular subject "Generative Pre-trained Transformer."

References are indicated with numbers (e.g., [1], [2], etc.) as placeholders for the actual citation format you might be using.
If the references are meant to be inline citations, they should be formatted according to the citation style you are following (e.g., APA, MLA, Chicago, etc.).

The paragraph is well-written and mostly clear, but I have made a few minor adjustments for clarity and flow:

In this work, we present a human-centric approach to using AI in manuscript writing.
Scholarly text, initially created by humans, is revised with edit suggestions from LLMs (large language models), and then ultimately reviewed and approved by humans.
This approach mitigates the risk of generating misleading information while still providing the benefits of AI-assisted writing.
We developed an AI-assisted revision tool that implements this approach, building on the Manubot infrastructure for scholarly publishing [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007128].
This platform is designed to enable both individual and large-scale collaborative projects [@doi:10.1098/rsif.2017.0387; @pmid:34545336].
Our tool, named the Manubot AI Editor, parses the manuscript, utilizes an LLM with section-specific prompts for revisions, and then generates a set of suggested changes to be integrated into the main document.
These changes are presented to the user through the GitHub interface for review.
During prompt engineering, we developed unit tests to ensure that the AI revisions meet a minimum set of quality standards.
For end-to-end evaluation, we manually reviewed the AI revisions on three Manubot-authored manuscripts that included sections of varying complexity.
Our findings indicate that, in most cases, the models were able to maintain the original meaning of the text, improve the writing style, and even correctly interpret mathematical expressions.
Now officially part of the Manubot platform, our Manubot AI Editor can be readily incorporated into Manubot-based manuscripts.
We anticipate that it will help authors communicate their work more effectively.

Note: The references (e.g., [@doi:...]) are placeholders for actual citations and should be replaced with the corresponding references in the final document.
