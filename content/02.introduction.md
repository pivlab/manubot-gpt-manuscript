## Introduction

The tradition of scholarly writing dates back thousands of years, evolving significantly with the advent of scientific journals approximately 350 years ago (ISBN: 0810808447).
External peer review, which is used by many journals, is even more recent, having been around for less than 100 years (DOI: 10/d26d8b).
Most manuscripts are written by humans or teams of humans working together to describe new advances, summarize existing literature, or argue for changes in the status quo.
However, scholarly writing is a time-consuming process where the results of a study are presented using a specific style and format.
Academics can sometimes be long-winded in getting to key points, making their writing more impenetrable to their audience (DOI: 10.1038/d41586-018-02404-4).

Recent advances in computing capabilities and the widespread availability of text, images, and other data on the internet have laid the foundation for artificial intelligence (AI) models with billions of parameters.
Large language models (LLMs), in particular, are opening the floodgates to new technologies with the capability to transform how society operates (Arxiv:2102.02503).
OpenAI's models, for instance, have been trained on vast amounts of data and can generate human-like text (Arxiv:2005.14165).
These models are based on the transformer architecture, which uses self-attention mechanisms to model the complexities of language.
The most well-known of these models is the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT-3 and, more recently, GPT-4), which have been shown to be highly effective for a range of language tasks such as generating text, completing code, and answering questions (Arxiv:2005.14165).
In the realm of medical informatics, scientists are beginning to explore the utility of these tools in optimizing clinical decision support (DOI:10.1093/jamia/ocad072) or assessing their potential to reduce health disparities (DOI:10.1093/jamia/ocad245), while also raising concerns about their impact on medical education (DOI:10.1093/jamia/ocad104) and the importance of keeping the human aspect central in AI development and application (DOI:10.1093/jamia/ocad091).
These tools have also been used to enhance scientific communication (DOI:10.1038/d41586-022-03479-w).
This technology has the potential to revolutionize how scientists write and revise scholarly manuscripts, saving time and effort and enabling researchers to focus on more high-level tasks such as data analysis and interpretation.
However, the use of LLMs in research has sparked controversy, primarily due to their propensity to generate plausible yet factually incorrect or misleading information.

In this work, we present a human-centric approach for the use of AI in manuscript writing.
Initially, scholarly text is created by humans and then revised through edit suggestions from LLMs.
Ultimately, the revised manuscript is reviewed and approved by humans.
This approach helps mitigate the risk of generating misleading information while still providing the benefits of AI-assisted writing.
We have developed an AI-assisted revision tool called the Manubot AI Editor, which implements this approach.
It builds on the Manubot infrastructure for scholarly publishing, a platform designed for individual and large-scale collaborative projects.
The Manubot AI Editor parses the manuscript, utilizes an LLM with section-specific prompts for revision, and generates a set of suggested changes to be integrated into the main document.
These changes are presented to the user through the GitHub interface for review.
During prompt engineering, we developed unit tests to ensure that the AI revisions meet a minimum set of quality measures.
To evaluate the tool, we manually reviewed the AI revisions on three Manubot-authored manuscripts that included sections of varying complexity.
Our findings indicate that, in most cases, the models were able to maintain the original meaning of the text, improve the writing style, and even interpret mathematical expressions.
The Manubot AI Editor is now officially part of the Manubot platform and can be easily incorporated into Manubot-based manuscripts.
We anticipate that it will help authors more effectively communicate their work.
