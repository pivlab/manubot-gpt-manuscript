## Abstract {.page_break_before}

The paragraph is well-written and mostly error-free.
However, I have made a few minor adjustments for clarity and flow:

In this work, we investigate the use of advanced natural language processing (NLP) models to streamline the time-consuming process of writing and revising scholarly manuscripts.
To this end, we have integrated large language models into the Manubot publishing ecosystem to suggest revisions for scholarly texts.
Our AI-based revision workflow employs a prompt generator that incorporates manuscript metadata into templates, generating section-specific instructions for the language model.
The model then produces revised versions of each paragraph for human authors to review.
We evaluated this methodology through three case studies of existing manuscripts, including the revision of this very manuscript.
Our results suggest that, despite some limitations, these models are capable of grasping complex academic concepts and enhancing the quality of the text.
All changes to the manuscript are meticulously tracked using a version control system, ensuring transparency in distinguishing between human- and machine-generated content.
Given the significant time researchers invest in crafting prose, the incorporation of large language models into the scholarly writing process has the potential to markedly improve the efficiency of academic knowledge work.
Our approach also enables scholars to focus on the critical aspects of their work, such as the novelty of their ideas, while automating more tedious tasks like adhering to specific writing styles.
Although the use of AI-assisted tools in scientific authoring is not without controversy, our approach—which emphasizes revising human-written text and provides transparent change-tracking—can help to alleviate concerns regarding the role of AI in scientific writing.
